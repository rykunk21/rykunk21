Passionate about ecology, technology, astronomy, and coffee, I'm a 21-year-old Computer Engineer out of Michigan State University. I loved to learn what it means to be an engineer, and have determined with 100% certainty this is the line of work I belong in. Building a fruitful career is the next step. Sustainability is the priority for my generation's future, and technology will create necessary optimizations for the agriculture industry. We need better AI, efficient water use practices, and resource management systems, all while maintaining financial viability for our farms. I intend to work with like-minded people to build these systems.
